# Goals of an Operating System

An **Operating System (OS)** is a system program that acts as an intermediary between the **user** and the **computer hardware**. It provides an environment in which users can execute programs efficiently and conveniently.

## Main Goals of an Operating System

The primary goals of an operating system are:

- To execute user programs and make solving user problems easier  
- To make the computer system convenient to use  
- To use computer hardware efficiently  

---

## 1. Convenience

The operating system makes the computer easier for users to operate.

**Example:**  
A graphical user interface (GUI) such as **Windows** or **Linux GUI** allows users to open files and run programs without typing complex commands.

---

## 2. Efficiency

The operating system uses hardware resources efficiently.

**Example:**  
CPU scheduling allows multiple programs to run smoothly by sharing processor time.

---

## 3. Resource Management

The operating system allocates and manages resources among programs.

**Example:**  
Memory management ensures that each program gets enough RAM without interfering with other programs.

---

## 4. Reliability and Error Handling

The operating system detects and handles errors to keep the system stable.

**Example:**  
If a program crashes, the OS stops that program without affecting other running programs.

---

## 5. Security and Protection

The operating system protects data and resources from unauthorized access.

**Example:**  
User login systems and file permissions prevent unauthorized access to files and system resources.

---

## Conclusion

An operating system is essential for providing convenience, efficiency, reliability, and security while managing computer hardware effectively. Without an OS, using a computer would be complex and inefficient.
